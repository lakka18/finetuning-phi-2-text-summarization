The new Iraqi government headed by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is a necessary first step in the process of pulling the country back together and leading a united national drive to oust the Islamic State (IS) radicals. But its success is far from guaranteed.,"### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: Legacy of mistrust haunts new Iraqi government
With Sunnis and Kurds fairly represented alongside the Shia majority, the cabinet has been hailed by the Americans as the ""inclusive"" new administration for which they were hoping and pushing.
Both the Sunnis and the Kurds had pulled out of the outgoing government of Nouri Maliki, who was widely blamed - including by Washington - for precipitating the current crisis by monopolising power and pursuing sectarian policies which alienated and marginalised the Sunnis in particular, fuelling grievances which the IS militants were swift to exploit.
Success or failure for the Abadi government in the grand endeavour to uproot IS will hinge on the extent to which it can meet those grievances, and convince the Sunni communities in whose areas the militants have taken root that they will have a reliably better future if they turn against the radicals and join the broader drive to oust them.
Without that, the Americans will find themselves backing one side in what is already in many ways a vicious sectarian civil war, fulfilling the warning by the former US commander in Iraq, David Petraeus, that they could end up becoming the air force of the Shia militias.
That already happened 10 days ago, when US air strikes helped Iranian-backed Shia militias break the IS siege of the northern town of Amerli, with nominal support from Iraqi army forces and artillery backup from the Kurds.
Amerli may have been exceptional in that it is a Shia town. But Sunni villages around it, which had been caught up in the struggle and went along with IS whether they wanted to or not, have been trashed, and their inhabitants will never go back.
If the same formula is applied unchanged to the Sunni heartlands where IS has taken root, it will clearly be disastrous.
That is why the White House said, after a congratulatory phone call from US President Barack Obama to Prime Minister Abadi, that the two men had agreed on ""the importance of having the new government quickly take concrete steps to address the aspirations and legitimate grievances of the Iraqi people"".
This was clearly a reference to the Sunnis, and implied recognition that to bring them fully on board, much more will have to be done than simply giving them some seats in government.
In the political programme he announced to parliament before presenting his ministers, Mr Abadi proposed widespread devolution to the provinces, including security, in which local people would be engaged in ""forming national guards that will be the main pillar for security in the governorates"".
If followed through swiftly and sincerely, measures proposed by Mr Abadi would go a long way towards meeting bitter Sunni complaints about marginalisation, victimisation and oppression.
But the legacy of mistrust is strong. Sunni tribal and former military rebels, who turned on al-Qaeda and expelled it from western Anbar province in 2007, felt betrayed when promises made by Baghdad were not fulfilled.
They say they are willing to join the campaign to oust IS now, but they want international guarantees of some sort that there will be a new deal for them, and that they will not be sidelined again.
Empowering the Sunnis to take on IS themselves, albeit with outside help, might mean that the Americans and others have to work with Sunni rebels who took up arms against them after 2003.
But they did that before, from 2007 on with the Awakening Councils - Sunni tribal militants who had been aligned to al-Qaeda but turned around.
The Shia militias for whom the Americans provided air cover at Amerli were the same who battled US troops on the ground - even abducting and killing American soldiers - during those same years.
All concerned seem willing to shelve past grudges to combat what they see as the bigger and more imminent and existential threat posed by IS.
For the Americans, and for the Iraqi Shia and Kurds, that may even mean working with Saddam Hussein's former Baathist adherents, who make up a significant part of the hard core of the Sunni nationalist rebellion.
All of this because the Iraqi army as such is currently in disarray, as evidenced by its spectacular collapse within hours when IS overran Mosul and much of the north in June. Reconstructing it into a cohesive fighting force is not something that can be done overnight.
To defend Baghdad and its approaches, Mr Maliki was forced to mobilise the same Shia militias against which he threw the Iraqi army into battle in 2008, under the slogan of ""imposing the law"".
One of the first practical challenges still facing his successor, Mr Abadi, is to fill the key jobs of defence and interior ministers, which he had to leave open - he said for only a week - because there was no consensus on the candidates.
Defence had been expected to go to a Sunni, while the man most cited as the next interior minister, Hadi al-Amiri, is the leader of one of the Shia militias, the heavily Iranian-backed Badr organisation - something the Sunnis are unlikely to accept.
Mr Abadi has said he wants to appoint a Sunni as defence minister, but he has not said who. He has said he wants to appoint a Sunni as interior minister, but he has not said who.

The Scottish government still intends to introduce its named person scheme despite a Supreme Court ruling.,"### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: Named person 'will still be introduced'
The controversial proposals would appoint a single person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to look out for the welfare of every child.
But the Supreme Court ruled that part of the legislation relating to data sharing breached human rights laws.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the necessary changes to the scheme would be made.
Mr Swinney told the BBC: ""What the government is going to do is to consider carefully the judgement of the Supreme Court, which requires us to make some changes to the information sharing arrangements of the named person scheme.
""Then we will proceed to implement the named person scheme, which the Supreme Court judged to be unquestionably legitimate.""
Campaigners against named person appealed to the Supreme Court in London after their case was dismissed as ""hyperbole"" by the Court of Session in Edinburgh last year.
They have described named person as a ""state snooper"" scheme that would undermine parents and divert resources away from the most vulnerable children.
But the Scottish government accused opponents of misrepresenting the proposals, and insisted they would help to protect vulnerable children while giving a single point of contact for parents who needed help or advice.
In its ruling, Supreme Court judges allowed the campaigners' appeal and said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"".
This meant that the data sharing part of the legislation was ""incompatible with the rights of children, young persons and parents"" under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which deals with the right to privacy and a family life.
But the judges also said that the purpose of the legislation was ""unquestionably legitimate and benign"" and gave Scottish ministers ""an opportunity to correct the defects"".
Mr Swinney said named person was an ""important scheme that is designed to support the wellbeing of young people in Scotland, to provide them with the support when they require it"".
He added: ""It has been very broadly supported by the Scottish Parliament, and it will be taken forward by the Scottish government.""
The scheme was originally to be rolled-out across the country by 31 August, but the Supreme Court ruling means that will not now be possible.
However, BBC Scotland understands that the government is hopeful the legislation can be relatively easily redrafted to make it fully compliant with the ECHR, and that it could potentially be introduced before the end of the year assuming the changes are approved by the Scottish Parliament.
Lawyer Elaine Motion, who represented The Christian Institute and six other petitioners in the legal challenge, said: ""This is a highly significant and extremely unusual judgement. Successful challenges to legislation are very rare.
""In layman's terms, the Supreme Court has said that the Scottish Government has overstepped the line drawn by Article 8 to protect and respect private and family life.""
The Christian Institute co-ordinated the successful legal action, with its director Colin Hart saying: ""This ruling is crystal clear that the named person scheme's cavalier approach to handling private information is unlawful and must not happen.""
Simon Calvert, spokesman for the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) campaign group, claimed: ""The Big Brother scheme is history.
""It's wonderful news for mums, dads and children all across Scotland who no longer have to worry about this unjustified invasion of their private lives.""
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the ""important ruling by the most senior court in the land"" was a ""victory for campaigners who have exposed this from the outset as illiberal, invasive and deeply-flawed"".
She added: ""We have consistently argued against the named person legislation on grounds of principle and practicality. I hope today's ruling will make the SNP stop and think again.""
The Scottish government wants Scotland to be ""the best place in the world for children to grow up"".
It has said that most children and young people get all the help and support they need from their parents, wider family and community, but sometimes they might need a bit of extra support.
As part of its Getting it Right for Every Child strategy, the government proposed giving all children and young people from birth to 18 years access to a named person under the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014.
The Scottish government says the named person is intended to be single point of contact if a child or their parents want information or advice, or if they want to talk about any worries and seek support.
They will also be a point of contact for other services if they have any concerns about a child's wellbeing.
The law had been due to come into force across the country on 31 August of this year, although the policy had already been rolled out in parts of Scotland, including Highland, Edinburgh, Fife, Angus, Perth and Kinross, Dumfries and Galloway and Argyll and Bute."

### Article: Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2-2 Dundee
Set-piece headers from Marcus Haber and Darren O'Dea gave the visitors a half-time lead.
Billy McKay pulled one back from the penalty spot after the break, and had a second spot-kick saved by Scott Bain.
His blushes were spared by Tansey, who rifled home from the edge of the box after Bain again denied McKay.
For the opening half hour, Inverness looked to have reacted to stinging criticism from boss Richie Foran and adapted well to a new formation with two up front.
They were hungry and creative and came close when Carl Tremarco struck the post from close range.
A quick-thinking Iain Vigurs free-kick released McKay, his cut-back was put home by a Dundee defender but McKay was ruled offside just when home supporters sensed a positive afternoon ahead.
Henri Anier was also denied by the excellent Bain as Inverness ploughed forward.
It went badly wrong with well executed goals and superb goalkeeping extending Inverness' winless run, despite fighting back from two goals down.
Dundee rode their luck a little early on but went ahead thanks to a superb delivery from Cammy Kerr straight into the path of Haber who powered his header home.
Their second was simple. Tom Hateley's corner was headed in by an unruffled O'Dea.
They got to half-time then handed Inverness a lifeline when Julien Extabeguren was unnecessarily penalised for holding.
McKay scored the penalty and was offered another chance when Anier went to ground. This time the superb Bain smothered it and Dundee looked good for the win.
They had a number of fabulous chances to extend their lead. Paul McGowan hit a post, then blazed over when clean through on goal before Henrik Ojamaa saw his close-range effort kicked clear.
Bain did well to save again from McKay but the rebound fell for Tansey and he coolly found the corner.
Inverness' winless run has now reached 13 and they face a very tough run of fixtures following their Scottish Cup fifth-round tie at Celtic next weekend.
Foran will be pleased with many elements of this display. It's results they need, though, and they're looking ever more fragile.
Inverness assistant manager Scott Kellacher: ""We asked the boys to be brave, get on the ball, pass it and that's exactly what they did. We need to defend balls into the box better but apart from that the heads never went down.
""The boys did great, terrific. They just keep going. The amount of chances we've created today, we need to start taking them if we're going to win games.
""We'll keep going. It's a special group. they've been through good times, they've been through bad.  We need to keep believing in ourselves and hopefully we can turn it around.""
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: ""There were chances at both end. At 2-0 we looked comfortable. We give a needless penalty away to give them a lifeline but after that we still had great opportunities. We should have killed the game off.
""Scott (Bain) is a real class act. His form has been excellent of late. I was pleased with how we performed in the final third today.
""We create chances. I think Ojamaa and Haber had a good understanding. The pleasing aspect is we created. The disappointing thing was we should have seen the game out. That's something we've got to look at.""

Jonny Evans, Aaron Hughes and Chris Baird impressed as the visitors played deep and challenged Scotland to try to break through a well-organised defensive shape.
Gibraltar will seek to do the same at Hampden at the weekend, so the friendly turned into an occasion for the Scots to hone their attacking play.
They were at their sharpest down the left, where Ikechi Anya's fearsome pace was a constant threat, and tended to leave Paddy McNair looking vulnerable.
The young Manchester United defender was one of several fringe players that O'Neill brought to the fore.
MK Dons' Will Grigg led the line, where he was often isolated, while Josh Magennis of Kilmarnock was a powerful and direct runner down the right.
Brentford's Stuart Dallas and MK Dons' Ben Reeves, both earning their second caps, were intermittently busy.
So, too, was Northern Ireland goalkeeper Michael McGovern.
His interventions often came after Anya had burst to prominence. On one occasion, the left winger raced into the penalty area, then cut the ball back for Steven Fletcher whose snap shot was turned over by Hamilton's McGovern.
The Northern Ireland goalkeeper had to dive smartly to push an Anya shot wide, then when the winger was played into the penalty area by James McArthur, he shot wide from a good position.
A clever reverse pass from Shaun Maloney provided a shooting opportunity for Steven Fletcher, but McGovern dashed out quickly to block.
Evans was marshalling the visiting defence, in the midst of a domestic ban for spitting at the Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse.
The Manchester United centre-back was composed throughout, helped by the solid reliability of his partner, Brighton centre-back Hughes, and by the industry and conscientious running of West Brom's Baird and Reading's Oliver Norwood in midfield.
The approach was to try to deny Scotland, rather than control the game, but Northern Ireland pressed more assertively, and higher up the field, after the break.
Scotland were less able to control the game, as substitutions disrupted their rhythm as much as the visitors' approach.
Steven Naismith carried a threat in the air, though, flashing one header over from Craig Forsyth's cross, then seeing an effort from Ritchie's corner saved by McGovern.
Ritchie drifted in and out of the game on his debut, but there was promise in the delivery from his left foot.
Familiar faces came on to bolster Northern Ireland, including former Rangers midfielder Steven Davis and his one-time Celtic rival Paddy McCourt, while another - Magennis - came close with a shot across the face of goal.
The game seemed destined to finish as a stalemate, but Ritchie's delivery from set-pieces tended to be threatening and Scotland finally made the breakthrough when Berra headed his corner kick past McGovern.
There were only four minutes left, and Northern Ireland had no riposte.

Nottingham Forest have been bought by Greek shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis after his takeover was passed by the English Football League (EFL).,"### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: Nottingham Forest takeover: Evangelos Marinakis buys club with EFL approval
Media playback is not supported on this device
The businessman and Olympiakos owner is facing accusations of match-fixing in Greece but has passed the EFL's owners' and directors' test.
Marinakis' buyout brings to an end Fawaz Al Hasawi's five-year reign in charge of the Championship club.
A previous takeover by a United States consortium fell through in January.
In an exclusive interview with BBC Sport, Marinakis said that allegations he is involved in a ""criminal organisation"" were invented by ""jealous"" opponents to ""destroy"" his success with the Greek champions.
He was previously accused of being involved in the bombing of a referee's bakery but faced no action.
Marinakis, who is heading a consortium with Greek businessman Socrates Kominakis, denies all the claims and has not faced any charges. He is waiting to find out whether a remaining case against him will proceed, but says: ""I have nothing to be afraid of and to worry about as I have done nothing wrong.""
The EFL has approved the deal after reviewing the business plan and applying the owners' and directors' test. It saw no reason to disqualify the prospective owners under the test. The EFL also asked Uefa for its views on Marinakis' ownership of Olympiakos and received a positive response.
Two-time European Cup winners Forest only escaped relegation to England's third tier on goal difference with a win on the final day of the season.
Marinakis has also ""guaranteed"" manager Mark Warburton, who was appointed in March, will be with the club ""for a number of years"".
In an interview with BBC correspondent Richard Conway, Marinakis spelt out his vision for Nottingham Forest. He says he will:
Under Marinakis' ownership since 2010, Olympiakos have won seven domestic championships in a row. They are among the top-25 ranked teams in Europe.
He told BBC Sport that claims of criminality against him are as a result of this record.
""All these years, a lot has been said but nothing came out in reality. All of it has been dismissed and we have been clear from all of this,"" he said.
""Now there is a last case remaining - there are about 80 persons involved. I can tell you again that I have nothing to do with it because I know very well what I have done and how I have achieved victories.
""Of course I cannot stop our opponents talking or bad-mouthing.""
He added the EFL and other football authorities, such as European governing body Uefa, have cleared him after ""two months"" of ""numerous questions"".
Marinakis attended high school in Watford from the age of 15 and went on to university in the UK.
He told the BBC he chose to invest in Forest based on ""what I remember from the past and the potential the club has"".
He added: ""I think that it doesn't take long to decide, even if you have a choice, which team to go for. When you see all this tradition and all these achievements, of course this club has the potential to grow and achieve victories that the whole region deserves.""
""I'm not going to promise you things or I'm not a rich guy who came from abroad to spend my money and gain glory by acquiring a team in the UK.
""I had glories from my times with Olympiakos who have won everything, who have broken every record both within our country and in Europe, in the Champions League for our level.
""We know a lot of players, managers, clubs, officials in various parts of the world in international football, agents - all this can help us to put all our connections together and try to do our very best for Nottingham.""
Forest, league champions in 1977-78 and European Cup winners in the following two seasons, last played in the Premier League in 1998-99. They have since spent 14 seasons in the second tier and three seasons in League One, from 2005-06 to 2007-08.
Despite narrowly escaping a return to the third tier this season, Marinakis believes Forest should be in the Premier League.
""We have a long-term plan and within this long-term plan we want to bring Nottingham to where it belongs. And of course Nottingham belongs in the Premier League. And Nottingham belongs to the elite of the Premier League,"" he says.
""Furthermore the supporters of Nottingham have been tired all these years, they didn't have such good times. But they remained loyal and for us that's very important.
""The potential is huge. The potential of this team is that when it will be very well organised, when it will achieve victories again, when it will have a better position in the Championship, when it will have a better position in the Premier League, when it will have a better position in the Champions League, when it will have a better position in the Europa League, when it will have a better position in the Super Cup, when it will have a better position in the FA Cup, when it will have a better position in the League Cup, when it will have a better position in the Community Shield, when it will have a better position in the Intercontinental Cup, when it will have a better position in the FIFA Club World Cup, when it will have a better position in the UEFA Super Cup, when it will have a better position in the UEFA"

Brad Pitt has chosen the pages (and website) of a glossy magazine to give his first interview since splitting from Angelina Jolie amid accusations he'd hit their teenage son. It was a calculated attempt to rehabilitate his image - and it seems to have worked.,"### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: How Brad Pitt fixed his image problem with one interview
It's seven months since Brangelina broke apart against the backdrop of reports of a physical altercation between Brad and 15-year-old Maddox on a private plane.
Social workers and the FBI took no action against Pitt. There were also rumours of an affair with his co-star Marion Cotillard - which she denied.
But his reputation had been called into question and he has kept a low profile since.
So how does one of Hollywood's biggest stars begin to fix his image and move on? The answer seems to be - by doing an eight-day photoshoot mucking about in America's national parks and a long, confessional and philosophical interview with GQ Style.
As one of the most famous people on the planet, Pitt had to talk about his problems sooner or later, attempt to take control of the story and move on.
And he's got a new film coming out - which gets several prominent mentions in the article. He needs to promote that by talking to the media, as he will need to do for future releases.
He can't dodge the subject of his divorce and personal problems. But he can choose which outlet he uses to speak about them, and what they say.
In giving his first post-split interview to GQ Style, he's chosen a publication that is glossy in both format and interview tone. GQ correspondent Michael Paterniti's questioning was gently probing but sympathetic. He didn't ask what went on in the plane.
The choice of GQ wasn't likely to put too many rival media noses out of joint, and was guaranteed to be picked up by virtually every news outlet around the world.
And he will have had control over what went in the article, according to PR guru Mark Borkowski. ""Total copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,"" he says.
Pitt ""looks good and has admitted he's had a problem,"" Borkowski says. ""So it's very transparent and very honest. To be as upfront and direct as he's been, it is a remarkable moment in his career.""
The headlines from the interview have been, depending on which website or paper you read: Brad has had therapy to get through his divorce; he's admitted drink problems; he listened to Frank Ocean to get over the split; and he wore the same $1,000 (Â£775) tank top as Harry Styles.
In the bits about his divorce, he is conciliatory and admits the chaos of the past half-year has been ""self-inflicted"", but he's putting ""family first"".
He ""refuses"" to get into a vicious court battle with Angelina and says they've got to handle the situation with ""great care and delicacy"" for the children.
Verdict? He's the honest and sensitive guy we always knew he was.
E! published an article headlined: Why Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword.
""This interview could have been a more obstinate denial of wrongdoing on Pitt's part,"" E!'s Natalie Finn wrote. ""Yet it was quite the opposite.
""Throwing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of good will built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he's gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he's doing to right the ship.""
In Vanity Fair, Kenzie Bryant wrote: ""Pitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook.
""Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way.""
Bryant added: ""He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he's doing a lot of work on himself.""
And in an article praising his ""openness and honesty"" about his alcohol problems on Huffington Post, Ryan Hampton of Facing Addiction wrote: ""Brad, I lift a cranberry-and-Perrier to you.
""People like you do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery.""
Not everyone was totally convinced, though.
Many celebrities would have tried to hide or snipe at their ex through the media, but Pitt is dealing with it ""in the most humane way possible"", Borkowski says.
""He was always going to be plagued with this story. So if you're going to talk about it, talk about it in a way that's going to help you move on.
""I don't think he's going to be able to get rid of it completely, but I think he's going to be able to move on from it.""
He's not going to be able to get rid of it completely, but I think he's going to be able to move on from it.

The author of the inquiry into the Iraq War is facing criticism after announcing his report would not be published until June or July 2016.,"### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: Iraq Inquiry publication date criticised
Prime Minister David Cameron said he was ""immensely frustrated"" at how long  Sir John Chilcot's inquiry, which began in 2009, was taking.
The mother of a British soldier killed in Iraq said it was ""another let-down"".
Sir John said the two million word report would be finished in April and then given national security checks.
Mr Cameron offered resources to speed up the process, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the time taken was ""getting beyond ridiculous"".
The inquiry is considering how UK forces came to participate in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its aftermath.
The new publication timetable was set out in a letter to Mr Cameron on the inquiry's website.
Sir John had previously rejected calls to publish a timetable for publication, saying he did not want to ""arouse false hopes"".
But in his letter, Sir John says the text of his report should be completed in the week starting 18 April 2016, at which point the process of national security checking would begin.
Such checking is ""normal and necessary"" with inquiries handling large amounts of sensitive material, he said.
It will ensure that national security and Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life, are not ""inadvertently breached"" by publication, he said.
""I consider that once national security checking has been completed it should be possible to agree a date for publication in June or July 2016,"" he added.
Sir John ended his letter to the prime minister saying: ""My colleagues and I remain committed to producing a report that will meet the very wide ranging terms of reference we were given and reflect the considerable investment of time and effort by all involved.""
In his letter back to Sir John, Mr Cameron welcomed the fact there was ""a clear end in sight"" but added: ""I am disappointed - and I know the families of those who served in Iraq will also be disappointed - that you do not believe it will be possible logistically to publish your report until early summer.""
He said he would welcome measures to ""expedite"" the final stages, saying the government would be ""very happy"" to provide more resources if it meant the inquiry was published sooner.
The prime minister said the government intended for the national security checking to last no longer than two weeks.
Speaking later at a summit in Iceland, the PM said he was ""immensely frustrated by the slowness and the amount of time that it has taken"".
He added: ""And I'm not frustrated on my own behalf, I'm frustrated for the mums and the dads who lost loved ones and who want to know what happened and why it happened and want to make sure that the lessons are learnt.""
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We need to know what happened, we need to know why it happened, we need to know who made the decisions and we never need to make these kind of catastrophic mistakes again.""
Addressing MPs in the House of Commons, Speaker John Bercow said there was ""a very real sense of anger and frustration across the whole House at what seems a substantial disservice that has been done"".
A statement from former Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said he looked forward to responding to the report.
He has repeatedly stressed he was not the reason for the drawn-out timescale, a point he repeated in his statement.
Any delays were ""not the result either of issues over the correspondence between him as prime minister and President Bush; or due to the Maxwellisation process,"" his office said.
Mr Blair and other witnesses had been given information under Maxwellisation ""very late in the process"", the statement said, adding that suggestions he had been the cause of delays in publication were ""categorically incorrect"".
Reg Keys, whose son, Lance Corporal Tom Keys, was killed in Iraq in June 2003, was critical of the ""ridiculous"" Maxwellisation process, saying it had been allowed to ""run on far too long"".
He predicted the report, when it was eventually published, would be a ""watered-down"" version of criticism raised during the inquiry.
The mother of Royal Highland Fusilier Gordon Gentle, who was killed aged 19 in a bomb attack in Basra in 2004, said she was ""disappointed"" by the latest news from the inquiry.
Rose Gentle, from Glasgow, said: ""We thought it should be out a lot sooner than this. I thought it would be out by the end of the year, because they have everything there.
""It's another let-down. It's another few months to wait and suffer again.""
Timeline: The Iraq War inquiry
by James Landale, BBC deputy political editor
Usually, politicians like independent inquiries - they use them to outsource and delay difficult decisions.

"There are on average 14 tracking tools per webpage on the UK's most popular sites, according to a study.","### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: 'Action needed' to meet UK's cookie tracking deadline
Privacy solutions provider Truste suggests that means a user typically encounters up to 140 cookies and other trackers while browsing a single site.
The research was published less than 40 days before strict rules come into effect governing cookie use.
The study was carried out in March and covered the UK's 50 most visited organisations.
The firm said that 68% of the trackers analysed belonged to third-parties, usually advertisers, rather than the site's owner.
""The high level of third-party tracking that is taking place is certainly an area of question and scrutiny,"" Dave Deasy, Truste's vice president of marketing, told the BBC.
""It's not illegal to do the tracking - the question is whether you are giving consumers enough awareness that it is happening and what you are doing with the data.""
On 26 May the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) imposes an EU directive designed to protect internet users' privacy.
The law says that sites must provide ""clear and comprehensive"" information 
about the use of cookies -  small files which allow a site to recognise a visitor's device.
It says website managers must:
""The information needs to be upfront - without information people can't give consent,"" the ICO's principal policy adviser for technology, Simon Rice, told the BBC.
The ICO says the rules cover cookies used to provide information to advertisers, count the number of unique visitors to a page and recognise when a user has returned to a site to adjust the content that is subsequently displayed.
However, it says exceptions are likely to be made if the cookie is only being used to ensure a page loads quickly by distributing the workload over several servers, or is employed to track a user as they add goods to a shopping basket.
Many sites have yet to add a feature asking for users' consent.
95% of 55 major UK-based organisations surveyed on behalf of KPMG were still not compliant with the cookie law at the end of last month, the accountancy firm reported
.
Truste acknowledges that the vast majority of those who took part in its study had published a privacy policy - but adds that only 16% had a summary section that was ""easily digestible"", and 80% did not disclose how long data about visitors was retained.
Cookies are small files that allow a website to recognise and track users. The ICO groups them into three overlapping groups:
Session cookies
Files that allow a site to link the actions of a visitor during a single browser session. These might be used by an internet bank or webmail service. They are not stored long term and are considered ""less privacy intrusive"" than persistent cookies.
Persistent cookies
These remain on the user's device between sessions and allow one or several sites to remember details about the visitor. They may be used by marketers to target advertising or to avoid the user having to provide a password each visit.
First and third-party cookies
A cookie is classed as being first-party if it is set by the site being visited. It might be used to study how people navigate a site.
It is classed as third-party if it is issued by a different server to that of the domain being visited. It could be used to trigger a banner advert based on the visitor's viewing habits.
The move has proved controversial.
A survey published last month by the digital marketing firm, Econsultancy, found that 82% of 700 marketers contacted did not believe the cookie law was a positive development.
One respondent said: ""Plain and simple - this will kill online sales.""
The claim reflects a belief that when presented with a choice, most users would refuse to allow cookies to track them - making it impossible, for instance, for a retailer to target adverts for a computer at a user who had previously looked at an article about upgrading IT equipment.
The ICO's own research suggests this could be an issue. Since asking users to click a box if they agree to accept cookies from its site, the organisation says just 10% of visitors have complied.
However, BT's experience points to a possible solution.
Since March a pop-up message on its home page has told first-time visitors that unless they take up an offer to change its settings, then they have consented to its ""allow all cookies"" default rule.
""So far, we can see that customers are generally choosing to keep the cookies that we use to provide the best experience on our webpages,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC.
The ICO says it has not been prescriptive about the wording that firms use.
However, organisations need to be careful about relying too heavily on opt-out schemes.
""At present evidence demonstrates that general awareness of the functions and uses of cookies is simply not high enough for websites to look to rely entirely in the first instance on implied consent,"" says the ICO's Mr Rice."

"Three months after the Brexit vote, the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) - France's financial regulator - is receiving a steady stream of enquiries from London-based companies about the possibilities of relocation.","### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: Paris turns charm on post-Brexit City of London
""It was quiet in July and August. But since the start of September, I've been taken by surprise by the number of calls we are getting,"" says AMF secretary-general Benoit de Juvigny.
""What they hate most, these businesses, is uncertainty. No-one can tell them what Brexit will look like. So more of them are looking to keep their options open by having an operation on the continent.""
Brexit is an opportunity that Paris financial operators say they wish they had never had.
To a man or woman, they were for the UK remaining in the EU - if only to help spread the free-market spirit.
But now that Brexit is coming, they would be mugs not to make the most of it.
A charm offensive is under way to lure from London as much financial business as possible - and to tempt back some of the tens of thousands of French expats who left to work there.
The Socialist government is on board, promising tax breaks for returnees, lower company rates and more international schools.
But the bulk of the work is being done by the financial industry itself, with teams of lobbyists visiting London to push the advantages of the French capital and to dispel misconceptions.
The central argument is that Brexit will lead to an end to so-called ""passporting"" - in other words, the possibility for a London-certificated business to sell its services across the 27 remaining EU members.
No-one knows if London firms will indeed lose their passports - the negotiations are not even close to starting - but in a way, that is the point.
As long as there is uncertainty, UK-based financial institutions may decide they need a base in Europe, in order to be sure to retain the access they now enjoy as a right.
At the AMF, they sense the appeal of their case, so to drive the point home, they have just made it easier for UK firms to apply for a French right to operate.
Under their two-week ticket, institutions currently regulated by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) can get a fast-track ""pre-authorisation"" to open for business in Paris.
After that, under the AMF's agility programme, the UK firm will be accompanied through the rest of the process by an English-speaking official with the aim of being fully certificated after two months.
The responsiveness of the French regulator is one of the changes - Paris advocates say - which will surprise newcomers.
""There has been a cultural revolution in Paris,"" says Alain Clot, head of Fintech France, which represents start-ups in digital finance.
""Today the French regulator talks to the entrepreneur at a very early stage. It helps them to fine-tune their start-ups. It accepts the idea of proportionality - which means it doesn't enforce the same rules for €1,000 (£875) as it does for €100,000.
""All this is very new and very important for people who need a human face in front of them when they start their business in the financial sector.""
For Mr Clot, Fintech - the fast-growing world of internet-based finance - is the area where London is most likely to lose business to Paris and other European centres.
Until now, most Fintech start-ups have chosen London, because of its looser regulatory system.
But with the improving regime in Paris, with easier access there to venture capital and other sources of finance - and above all with the risk of losing passporting rights once Brexit kicks in - there is now a strong case for pulling out of London.
""Relocating a bank can take a century. Relocating a start-up takes a few clicks,"" says Mr Clot.
But what, say the doubters, of France's notorious mistrust of money? Was it not the President himself - Francois Hollande - who said that the only enemy he had was the ""world of finance""?
The world has changed, is the answer from Arnaud de Bresson, chief executive of Paris Europlace, which promotes Paris as a financial centre.
""Twenty years ago I gave an interview to a journalist from the Financial Times, who said exactly that: that Paris could never be a financial centre. I said, just wait. And now look at us.""
Today Paris is indeed a major financial centre, helped by a large number of global companies, a growing capital market culture and high competence levels in data science.
Among the minuses are a tax regime that scares away high-earners, rigid hire-and-fire rules and an absence of pension funds.
So far, Paris has acted nimbly to take advantage of London's discomfort. No-one expects it to seriously challenge the UK capital. But a certain ""rebalancing"" is under way.
""We are not trying to replace London,"" says Mr de Juvigny. ""We are trying to complement it. We are trying to offer something that London can't offer.""
""We are not trying to replace London,"" says Mr de Juvigny. ""We are trying to complement it. We are trying to offer something that London can't offer.""

"There has been a slowdown in the British economy, driven by weaker construction, manufacturing and energy production - although it would be premature to see this as an end to the recovery.","### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: A slower recovery
GDP, or national income, grew 0.5% in the fourth quarter of the year, compared with 0.7% in the third and a recent peak of 0.8% in the second. That looks like a trend.
That said, annual growth in the last three months of the year was still a healthy 2.7%. In 2014 as a whole the economy expanded 2.6%.
The recovery is real. And it still has momentum, if less than before.
The deceleration is not surprising, in view of the flatlining of the UK's main trading partner, the eurozone.
And two of the negative influences, a fall in energy supply of 2.8% and in construction of 1.8%, are in industries that tend to be volatile.
That said, it does give pause for thought that growth is now apparently being driven to a large extent by retail and consumer spending.
This is potentially troubling, given that many would argue that the flaw in Britain's economy in the boom years before the crash and Great Recession of 2008 was that it was too reliant on debt-fuelled consumer spending.
There is some evidence from consumer debt figures that households are borrowing a bit more again. But there hasn't been a dramatic dip in the savings ratio. And it is arguable that consumers are spending the early windfalls from lower petrol prices.
But we were supposed to be rebalancing, towards manufacturing and investment. And although there has been a bit of that over the past couple of year, it appears to be petering out.
So in the latest period, all UK growth (and in fact a bit more than all) came from services, which rose 0.8%, identical to its growth in the previous quarter; manufacturing was just 0.1% higher, following a rise of 0.3% in the previous quarter.
What's the outlook for the months before the election?
Well the fall in gas and petrol prices, which puts money in our pockets, should continue to power household spending - and maintain the recovery at the kind of pace we enjoyed in 2014.
But one big uncertainty is what this does to our unsustainably large current account deficit, the gap between our earnings from and payments to the rest of the world, of 6% of GDP.
All that household consumption will suck in imports, but that may be offset by the lower price we are paying for oil.
So the economy retains structural weaknesses. And when I interview the chancellor later today, if he doesn't say that is all the more reason for the country to stick to his ""long term economic plan"" - including attempts to mend the public finances - then I may have reason to question my sanity.
And George Osborne will insist that Britain continues to grow significantly faster than most other developed economies - especially those across the Channel, but not America.
But as the election looms, there is an important question about who has paid most for the recovery, the rich or the poor?
The Treasury's position, repeated today, is that ""the richest 20% of households will contribute more to reducing the deficit than the remaining 80% put together"" and that the ""richest 10% of households have made the largest contribution to reducing the deficit"".
But that is not desperately surprising in a country which has a progressive income tax system - and in which the highest rate of income tax was initially increased (and then partly reversed).
And what may fuel an important debate between now and polling day is a series of detailed reports, written by academics from the London School of Economics and the Universities of York and Manchester, showing how certain poorer and vulnerable groups have been disproportionately hurt by austerity and budget cuts.
Perhaps the most damaging claim made in the reports is that cuts to tax credits and cash benefits took more away from those in the bottom half of the income spectrum than these poorer people gained from the significant increases to tax allowances.
And they say that whatever savings were made from this rebalancing of benefits and tax allowances were wiped out by cuts in income tax for the better off.
The Treasury's response is to criticise the authors for not taking into account ""the effects of changes to the vital public services on which so many rely"" - including the protection given to schools and health budgets.
But this may be to compare apples with pears. Because what LSE, Manchester and York have tried to do is look at different elements of tax and social policy, and examine its impact on specific groups - rather than come up with one simple number that shows that inequality had widened or narrowed (although they do say that poverty probably increased after 2012-13 and may get worse).
And they make two particularly resonant claims.
First, that families with children under five suffered significant cuts to services, as inflation-adjusted spending per child on childcare, Sure Start and early education services fell 25% between 2009-10 and 2012-13.
Second, that the poorest fifth of the population saw their incomes fall by £1,000 a year between 2010-11 and 2013-14, while the richest fifth saw their incomes rise by £2,000 a year.
The Treasury's response is to say that the LSE, Manchester and York reports ""do not take into account the effects of changes to the vital public services on which so many rely"" - including the protection given to schools and health budgets.
But this may be to compare apples with pears. Because what LSE, Manchester and York have tried to do is look at different elements of"

### Article: French Jews increasingly question their future
Every Saturday in synagogues across France these words are intoned - in French or in Hebrew - as part of the Shabbat service.
The Prayer for the French Republic goes back to 1808, when the Jewish community was formally recognised by Napoleon as one of France's three official religions.
It enshrines in holy language the special debt that French Jews have always felt to France, as the first country in Europe in which they were proclaimed full citizens.
Today that special link is once again under terrible strain,  as more and more French Jews question where their future lies.
Anti-Semitism has rich roots in France.
Twice in little over a century - first in the Dreyfus affair (when a Jewish officer was wrongly accused of treason) and then under Vichy in World War Two - Jews have been victims of a national quest for ideological or ethnic purity.
Today anti-Jewishness is back, but in a different guise.  And many Jews feel betrayed by the slowness of the French response.
They feel that for more than a decade the source of most anti-Jewish violence has been deliberately masked in order not to antagonise French Muslims.
Instead of saying explicitly that the new anti-Semitism came from elements in the Muslim community, it was more expedient for politicians and journalists to lump it all together as part of a historical phenomenon for which the whole of France could be held responsible. So goes the argument.
Thus  when Mohamed Merah began his murder spree in Toulouse in 2012, the theory that it was a far-rightist who was killing soldiers was nurtured in the media far longer than was plausible.
""We have been saying this for years, and only now have people begun to listen:  the danger to Jews here no longer comes from the far-right,"" says Michel Zerbib, editor-in-chief at the Jewish radio station RadioJ.
Vestiges of old European anti-Semitism remain.
Last month, former Socialist foreign minister Roland Dumas used language straight from the 1930s when he said that Prime Minister Manuel Valls was probably ""under the influence"" of his Jewish wife.
And the recent vandalism at a Jewish cemetery in Alsace was the work of local yobs, with some inarticulate folk-memory giving edge to their teenage destructive urges.
Jews in France:
But after the attacks in Paris and Copenhagen, obfuscation is no longer an option. The real threat to Jews - the mortal threat - is the Islamist one.
Many French Jews hope that the outpouring of national unity that followed the January attacks at Charlie-Hebdo and Hyper Cacher will now act as a bulwark.
""The legacy of these terrible events could be to end the feeling of solitude among French Jews,"" says Sacha Reingewitz, head of the Union of Jewish Students.
""Up till now the political and national mobilisation against anti-Semitic violence has been very weak. No way would there have been so many people demonstrating on 11 January, had the Jewish supermarket been the only target of the attacks.""
Today the French state is indeed mobilised like never before in defence of the Jewish community, with hard-hitting pronouncements from President Hollande and soldiers posted at Jewish schools,  community centres and places of worship.
For some Jews,  it is still not enough. Last year saw a big increase in the numbers emigrating to Israel - more than 7,000 - and 2015 will probably see the trend continue.
""Today it is an act of heroism just to wear a kippah on the street or to send your children to a Jewish school.  This in Paris in the 21st Century!  It really hurts,"" says Paris rabbi Mikael Journo.
According to Roger Cukierman, who heads the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF),  the increase in aliyah from France is directly attributable to the growing insecurity.
""Jews have had the feeling they are the pariahs of the nation,"" he says.
In Jewish households across the country,  there has been the same conversation.  It is one that Jews have had many times in history.  How to react to the violence? Is it safe? Should we leave?
But just as it is undeniable that more French Jews today are susceptible to the call to emigrate, it is equally true that the vast majority are not.
Many Jewish leaders - especially those of a left-wing tendency - are angry with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for (as they see it) playing up their insecurity and implying that France cannot protect them.
They also accuse him of cynically encouraging the notion of their dual allegiance (to France and to Israel) - even though he knows this feeds into anti-Semitism.
Like Jews everywhere, French Jews do feel a special bond with Israel.  But they also feel a special bond with France.
""France is our home,"" says Rabbi Journo. ""It is where we were born, where our grandparents were born, where our great-grandparents were born.  It is where we have lived all our lives.  It is where we want our children to grow up.  It is where we want our grandchildren to grow up.  It is where we want our great-grandchildren to grow up.  It is where we want to die.  It is where we want to be buried.  It is where we want"

### Article: Fergal O'Brien: Can 2017 be a showstopper for jump racing's rock and roll trainer?
Not only does O'Brien's extensive social media presence regularly feature the nation's teatime favourite, but the other day in the winners' room at Warwick I witnessed his eyes positively out on stalks at the prospect of a large Victoria sponge laid out on the bar.
It turns out cake is part of a strategy to make certain that the owners of the growing numbers of horses in the trainer's Cotswold string remain happy, even when things aren't going well.
He said: ""Someone asked me what I wanted to achieve, and I said to have winners and be fashionable, of course, but when an owner doesn't have a winner, they should still have a good time, and part of that is to get them back to the yard maybe for cake.
""The horses are not going to win every day - we have a good strike-rate at the moment of one winner in five, but that's also four losers in five.
""Actually, it all started with someone asking to visit the yard, and we said 'yes - if you bring a cake', and it all took off from there.
""The cakes keep arriving, homemade, in all shapes and sizes, and between the lads and the owners they all get eaten, there's no waste. I do love a Victoria sponge myself.""
And Team O'Brien, headed by the 44-year-old from the rich racing pastures of County Tipperary, Ireland, has been enjoying plenty of generous slices of action during this National Hunt campaign.
That strike-rate is part of what's set to be by far the 60-horse stable's best season, during which the eye has been drawn in particular to unbeaten Colin's Sister and Poetic Rhythm, who recently finished third in the Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham.
Meanwhile, stable veteran and old favourite Alvarado, twice fourth in the Grand National, travels to Scotland looking to bounce back in Britain's newest version of the feature, the 18th in all, the £40,000 Edinburgh National at Musselburgh.
The race - note that it's just a 'National', with no 'Grand' prefix, because officials believe there should be only one of them - is a sliver over four miles long, and puts the onus on the jockeys not to miscount as it's three circuits of the small, flat track.
Despite having successfully completed the Aintree course twice, Alvarado got no further than the second fence when taking part in the Becher Chase over the famous fences in December, sustaining a head injury in the process.
""I thought that this would be a great year for him after he ran a blinder at Cheltenham first time out [when sixth],"" said O'Brien, ""but he got a kick in the head at Aintree and he had a haematoma on the top of his neck, so we've given him a bit of time.
""He's the boss, a real character - we always say Alvarado trains Alvarado - but he seems in very good form, and goes well after a break so it'll be good to have a go at a good pot.""
Though the horse may struggle to make the cut for a return to the Grand National in April - only the top 40 in the weights get the chance to line-up - the 12-year-old is among the 110 entries.
There must be something in the Cotswold air because O'Brien's base is just across a muddy lane from another in-form trainer, Nigel Twiston-Davies.
Twiston-Davies is racking up all kinds of potential stars for jump racing's showpiece Festival at nearby Cheltenham in March, a list headed by Gold Cup hope Bristol De Mai and leading hurdler The New One.
O'Brien was assistant there for 18 years, having arrived when the trainer's jockey son Sam - now 24 and one of jump racing's go-to riders - was just 10 months old.
Their parting, as O'Brien went off to set up a training operation of his own, was not necessarily the most amicable of processes, but relations, especially now they're neighbours, are more cordial these days.
""Having been down the road at Cilldara Stud, we moved back to Nigel's top yard in July 2015 and since our first runner from here won, we've never looked back really.
""The confidence is going, we're rolling along with nice new horses and owners, and the whole place is buzzing.
""There are two gallops - whichever one Nigel is on, we're on the other, and I don't ever seem to get in his way, so it's a good working relationship.
""He's a great trainer, and I'm a great trainer, and we've got a lot of respect for each other.""
O'Brien, who has won the Cheltenham Gold Cup twice, the Grand National once and the Champion Hurdle three times, has been a fixture at Cheltenham for the better part of a decade.
He's won the Festival on three occasions, in 2008, 2010 and 2013, and has been runner-up twice, in 2009 and 2011.

Each qualified nation were assigned to one of four pots for the draw according to their Uefa coefficient ranking, which is based on all competitive results since September 2010.
Which of the finalists is ""practically the finished article"", and which is ""as interesting as an early morning trip to Ikea""?
Euro 2016 prospects: France were the last host nation to win the title, in 1984, and are among the favourites this time. With a dynamic and athletic midfield, allied to verve and pace in a three-man front line, they can be electric on the counter-attack.
Coach Didier Deschamps has brought unity to a squad riven by unrest for years; however, the blackmail case which has pitted striker Karim Benzema and attacking midfielder Mathieu Valbuena on opposite sides could yet undermine the team's chances.
Euro pedigree: Winners in 1984, as hosts, and 2000. This is their seventh successive Euros finals.
Key player: Blaise Matuidi. There are more celebrated French players, but 28-year-old Matuidi is the driving force in midfield, breaking up the opposition's play and springing forward with inexhaustible energy.
Deschamps has said the Paris St-Germain player is the ""first name on the team sheet"".
Premier League players: Hugo Lloris (Tottenham), Olivier Giroud, Laurent Koscielny, Mathieu Debuchy (all Arsenal), Morgan Schneiderlin, Anthony Martial (both Manchester United), Yohan Cabaye (Crystal Palace), Bacary Sagna, Eliaquim Mangala (both Manchester City), Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle), Mamadou Sakho (Liverpool), Kurt Zouma (Chelsea).
Who's the boss? Deschamps, 47, led the team to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2014, where they lost 1-0 to Germany. As a player, he captained France to victory at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.
Euro 2016 prospects: Romania possess the disciplined team ethic and strong defence that was characteristic of Greece's shock Euro 2004 triumph.
Nonetheless, national coach Anghel Iordanescu is not fooled by his side's fairly lofty world ranking of 16th - or the fact they had the best defensive record in qualifying, instead bemoaning the lack of players based in Europe's top leagues.
How they qualified: Dourly, as unbeaten Group F runners-up to Northern Ireland. Romania endured a national-record goal drought of 428 minutes which included a run of four straight draws in the second half of the campaign, but they only conceded twice in their 10 matches.
Euro pedigree: They reached the quarter-finals in 2000 by beating England with a last-minute penalty, conceded by Phil Neville. It is their only victory in 13 European Championship matches.
Key player: Vlad Chiriches. After two unconvincing seasons with Tottenham, the 26-year-old centre back is finding it equally difficult to cement a first-team place at Napoli, but he is an integral part of Romania's redoubtable defence.
Premier League players: Costel Pantilimon (Sunderland), Florin Gardos (Southampton).
Who's the boss? The world-weary Anghel Iordanescu was appointed for the third time in October 2014; he initially turned down the role but was persuaded of the need for his experience.
Iordanescu, 65, guided Romania to three successive major tournaments in the 1990s and was also in charge from 2002-04.
He quit football a few years later and served as a senator between 2008 and 2012.
Euro 2016 prospects: The most unfashionable side to qualify, and rank outsiders with Northern Ireland. The influence of their Italian coach is clear - they are organised, sit deep and frustrate the opposition, hoping to snatch a goal from set-pieces or long shots.
They stifled Portugal in qualifying, winning 1-0 away and only losing the return game in stoppage time.
How they qualified: They only scored seven goals - five of them against bottom side Armenia. That does not include their 3-0 win in Serbia, awarded by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after a riot.
That decision, and the shock win in Portugal, saw them finish second in Group I, two points ahead of Denmark.
Euro pedigree: Debutants.
Key player: In a workmanlike side, Basel midfielder Taulant Xhaka, 24, stands out for his technical ability and confidence on the ball. A former Swiss under-21 international, he's the elder brother of Switzerland's Granit Xhaka.
Premier League players: None.
Who's the boss? This is not the first time Italian Gianni de Biasi has been in charge of a Euro final. He guided Italy to the semi-finals in 2000 and 2004.
De Biasi, 68, is the longest-serving manager in the tournament's history.
Euro 2016 prospects: The only side to qualify without a single Premier League player.
How they qualified: They won all six of their matches, including a 2-0 win over England in the final game of qualifying.
Euro pedigree: They won the title in 1988, and have reached the semi-finals on three occasions.
Key player: The diminutive 19-year-old is the only player in"
There could be another writers strike in the US - putting dozens of your favourite TV shows at risk.,"### Instruction: Summarize the following article in one sentence.
### Article: Writers' Strike: Are US TV shows about to fall off air?
In a letter to media buyers, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has threatened to strike from 2 May.
It's to do with a row over pay - writers say they have been losing revenue in recent years, 23% in the last two years alone.
Also, because so many series are getting shorter but writers contracts remain the same length, many of them find themselves locked into a contract without other work.
""Should this [strike] occur, writing for television, feature films and digital series will cease,"" the letter says.
This would be catastrophic for the major networks, which were hugely affected when the WGA went on strike for 100 days in 2007.
Many TV networks struggled to fill their schedules, which led to an increase in repeats and reality TV shows.
In light of the letter, five days of negotiations are due to begin on Monday. If they don't go well - loads of your favourite shows could become victims of the strike.
Unlike the last time, many viewers will now be able to turn to streaming services to plug the gap in new content. However for traditional TV networks and film studios, a new strike would cause chaos.
Shows which are unscripted, don't use union writers or have already wrapped filming, wouldn't generally suffer. But here are some examples of shows which would.
The genre that would be impacted most immediately would be the live entertainment and late night chat shows.
Unlike UK talk shows fronted by the likes of Graham Norton and Jonathan Ross air weekly, most US chat shows - which are also broadcast in the UK - air every night.
As you can imagine, that requires a heck of a lot of material, and therefore a heck of a lot of writers.
The likes of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Saturday Night Live and The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon would struggle to stay on air.
During the last strike, talk shows hosted by David Letterman, Jon Stewart and Conan O'Brien all ran repeats instead of airing new programmes.
Many stayed off air until the strike was over, while some returned and filled air time by ad-libbing or airing previously-recorded segments.
O'Brien, Letterman and Jay Leno even started to pay some of their regular writers out of their own pockets to provide new material during the strike.
In 2007, some networks stockpiled episodes to try and minimise the impact of the writers' strike.
A few soap operas like Days of Our Lives and All My Children had their scripts completed to last them through to January, when the strike was due to end.
Dramas such as The Wire and The Shield also completed filming their current seasons and so were unaffected.
But others floundered.
Some shows were cancelled altogether, despite having ended on a cliff hanger (you can imagine how viewers reacted to that).
Others had their seasons cut short (Pushing Daisies), had new episodes delayed (24, Entourage) or their season length shortened (30 Rock, Breaking Bad, The Big Bang Theory).
Many of the shows due to begin this summer would likely be unaffected as they're already in production or completed, such as Veep, Fear The Walking Dead and Orange Is The New Black,
But shows which are due to begin in the crucial fall season, which writers begin working on in May and June, are at severe risk.
As the new letter from the WGA states: ""Any delay in the start of work has the potential to postpone fall season premieres and reduce the amount of new programming available to advertisers and audiences.""
This would affect brand new shows as well as programmes already hugely popular with audiences like Modern Family and Empire.
Of course, a strike wouldn't just impact TV shows - films can suffer as well.
Perhaps the most obvious casualty of the last one was the slightly dodgy James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.
Hot on the heels of the hugely popular and critically acclaimed Casino Royale, expectations for Daniel Craig's second Bond film were high.
But the actor famously ended up writing some sections of his own dialogue because of the lack of writers available to work on the movie.
The franchise redeemed itself with Skyfall and Spectre, but other standalone films didn't have that luxury.
Johnny Depp adventure drama Shantaram was put on hold because of strike related script issues and was never made
Oscar-nominated musical Nine, which starred Nicole Kidman, Daniel Day-Lewis and Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, was severely delayed.
Production had to be postponed from early 2008 to the second half of the year, pushing back its scheduled release date.
And at the height of awards season, the 2008 Golden Globes were cancelled with the winners read out at a press conference as there was no one to write the host's jokes.
Thankfully, the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) were able to come to an agreement before the 2007 strike began.
However, it's not clear if they'll be able to do the same this time around.
If they can't reach an agreement, the WGA will vote on whether to go ahead with the strike.
If the vote is in favour of a strike, it will begin on 2 May.
If it's not, the strike will be called off."
